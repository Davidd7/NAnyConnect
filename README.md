# N-Any-Connect

**What this project is:**
* A graphical user interface for easily switching between AnyConnect-VPN-Profiles on Windows
* A way to automatically reconnect to AnyConnect-VPN after the PC has been suspended

**Usage instructions:**
* AnyConnect has to be not already running (also not in the background - you can close it in the system tray)
* You can adapt the path of your anyconnect-executable by clicking on the gear-icon

**PLEASE NOTE: The storage of your password by this project is not very secure (it's comparable to creating a batch-file that includes your password in plain text)**
